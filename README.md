# additional-projects
Additional projects which I have done in my computer science classes.

Last semester, I took Programming Languages at Harvey Mudd College, the most advanced class in the Computer Science
major. In addition to the projects uploaded on my Github, I've done the following, which I can gladly provide
if you would like:

1) Built a program that generates random artwork
2) Wrote a compiler/translator that turns the Pic graphic design language into PostScript
3) Created a program that determines which parameter-passing technique is used by a system
4) Built a type-checking system for a subset of Haskell
5) Implemented the visitor pattern in C++
6) Built a scripting platform for Lua in C++
